# The BloxCards card library.

## What?
Bloxcards is a trading card place on ROBLOX scripted by Drager980. In BloxCards,
players can collect and trade over 500 cards and battle with their decks. The game is
heavily inspired by SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, sharing many of its core
mechanics but also adding some of its own (such as the inability to use white icons
as any icons).

## Then?
Everyone agreed it'd be a good idea to let the community handle the stats and effects of
the game's cards.

## Submission guidelines
Every change to every card should be its own commit. Do not cluster changes to multiple
cards into one big commit. Before you commit, copy-paste the contents of cardlib.lua
into a script and run said script in studio; fix all syntax errors. Do not commit
broken cardlibraries.
