# The Blox Cards Documentation

The General Card Effect Syntax
General case (single effect):

Effect = {
	Name
	Description
	Type
	Power
	Target
	Increase
}

The game executes the single effect as you would expect.

Sub-Effect case (multiple effects):

Effect = {
	Name
	Description
	Type
	Power = {
		{Power2, Increase2, Target2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}

In the event of subeffects, game will first look for a secondary 
target or increase. Should it not be able to find such secondary 
values, it will fall back to the primary one. Should there be no 
primary one but the effect does require it, the game crashes. 
Make sure all effects get the info they need to function.

For example, the following effect uses Target1 for its subeffect.
Effect = {
	Power = {
		{Power2, Increase2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}

This one uses Target2 but Increase1 for its subeffect.
Effect = {
	Power = {
		{Power2, nil, Target2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}

Card Properties
Card properties do not affect gameplay but instead describe what a
card is.

- Original
When a card is a cosmetic variation of another, this property
should be the index of the original card it inherits its gameplay
attributes from. Both cards should be complete and should function
identically.

- AltArt
When set to true, the card will appear in the minigames and be
disqualified from auctions. It will be treated as a special cosmetic
card.

- AltCards
This is a table of indices of all the alternate cards of an Original
card.

For example, the following tables form a valid alt card system:
["CardOne"] = {
	AltCards = {
		"CardOne-Artv";
		"CardOne Halloween";
	}
};
["CardOne-Artv"] = {
	AltArt = true;
	Original = "CardOne";
};
[CardOne Halloween"] = {
	Original = "CardOne";
}

In this example, CardOne is the Original card.
CardOne-Artv is an Alternate Art card and its Original is CardOne.
CardOne Halloween is special in that it is not an Alternate Art
card, but it does have an Original card. This allows it to share
deck slots with CardOne but not appear in the minigames.
